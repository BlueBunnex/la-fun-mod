# My mod

What do I like about Minecraft? Maybe I should actually play it to find out lol

### Implemented

- Sapphire and sapphire ore
  - Mineable with a diamond pickaxe
- Lich
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword

### Planned (maybe)

- I like dungeon crawling/looting
- I like RPG elements/mechanics
- I don't like stripmining
  - Maybe add mineshafts which are rather common?
  - Miner skeletons!
- Jungles
  - Tall trees (either oak or new yellow jungle wood)
  - Any oak leaf broken in a jungle has a chance to drop bananas
