# My mod

I'm adding whatever I want to this mod, on the sole condition that it makes me actually want to play the game.

### Implemented

WIP and subject to change.

- Sapphire and sapphire ore
  - Mineable with a diamond pickaxe
  - Maybe I'll make it only spawn in the nether?
- Lich
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - every once in a while, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
  - [inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)
  - [skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e)

### Planned

- I like dungeon crawling/looting
- I like RPG elements/mechanics
- I don't like stripmining
  - Maybe add mineshafts which are rather common?
  - Miner skeletons!
- Jungles
  - Tall trees (either oak or new yellow jungle wood)
  - Any oak leaf broken in a jungle has a chance to drop bananas

I should remember to playtest in survival.
