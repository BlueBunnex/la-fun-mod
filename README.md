I'm adding whatever I want to this mod, on the condition that it enhances my survival experience. This means doing
runs in survival and deducing from that what to add.

- End goal - defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - every once in a while, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
- RPG elements
  - iron bauble that does nothing
  - such a vibe
