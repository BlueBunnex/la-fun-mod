I'm adding whatever I want to this mod, on the condition that it enhances my survival experience. This means doing
runs in survival and deducing from that what to add.

- fairy pet that you have from the start of the game that you can level up?
- throw an end goal in there
  - currently it's just "touch a nether portal"
