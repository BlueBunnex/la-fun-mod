I'm adding whatever I want to this mod, on the sole condition that it makes me actually want to play the game.

- I like dungeon crawling/looting
- I like RPG mechanics
- I don't like stripmining

I should remember to playtest in survival.

## Currently in the mod (subject to change)

- End goal - defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - every once in a while, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
- RPG elements
  - iron bauble that does nothing
  - such a vibe
